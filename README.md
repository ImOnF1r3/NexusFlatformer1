# NexusPlatformer1

## Introduction
In a digital world where reality is mixed with code, NexusPlatformer1 transports you to a cybernetic dimension where every pixel counts. You've just discovered an ancient network called Nexus, a forgotten control system that hides a very important key. But there's a problem: Nexus is highly secured, and its levels are designed to be impossible to complete while respecting the rules of the game. Will you be the one to break them and get the key?

## Installation
To install and run the game on Windows, follow these steps:

2. Extract the archive to a directory of your choice. The password to extract the file can be found on HTB.
3. Run `HackTheBoxExecuteMe.exe` to start the game.

Good luck, and may your hacking skills lead you to the hidden key within Nexus!
